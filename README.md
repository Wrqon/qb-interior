## Notice
I modified this script for fun to play wih friends.

I have a busy professional and personal life. Therefore, I might not provide support or update this script.

Still, this script is absolutely free, as mods should always be. I think it is also better than 90% of the paid scripts scammers would have you pay $70 for.
